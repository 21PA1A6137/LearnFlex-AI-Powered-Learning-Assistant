The paper proposes a new architecture that replaces traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with self-attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrence and convolutions. The Transformer model uses multi-head attention, which allows it to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.
