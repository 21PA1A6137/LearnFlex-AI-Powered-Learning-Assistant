Here's a summary of the key points:\n\n* The document references several research papers on topics such as building large annotated corpora of English, self-training for parsing, attention models, and neural machine translation.\n* It introduces the concept of Scaled Dot-Product Attention, which is a type of attention mechanism used in machine learning models. This mechanism computes the dot products of the query with all keys, divides each by the square root of the dimension of the keys, and applies a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\n* The document also discusses Multi-Head Attention, which involves linearly projecting the queries, keys, and values multiple times with different learned linear projections, and then performing the attention function in parallel on each of these projected versions.\n* Additionally, the document includes figures and descriptions of usage patterns over a term, with spikes in queries corresponding to midterm and final exams, and increases in usage around due dates of lab activities.\n* The usage patterns are analyzed by creating histograms and binning the number of queries by hour of the day.\n\nSome key references mentioned in the document include:\n\n* Mitchell P Marcus, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, and Beatrice Santorini's work on building a large annotated corpus of English.\n* Ankur Parikh, Oscar T\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m, Dipanjan Das, and Jakob Uszkoreit's work on a decomposable attention model.\n* Romain Paulus, Caiming Xiong, and Richard Socher's work on a deep reinforced model for abstractive summarization.\n\nOverall, the document provides an overview of various machine learning and natural language processing concepts, including attention mechanisms and usage patterns.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"token_usage": {"completion_tokens": 353, "prompt_tokens": 1791, "total_tokens": 2144, "completion_time": 1.283636364, "prompt_time": 0.065090686, "queue_time": 0.058241148000000006, "total_time": 1.34872705}, "model_name": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f07de61dcd", "finish_reason": "stop", "logprobs": null}, "type": "ai", "name": null, "id": "run-0a24a7d4-a611-4c0f-95ae-850bf0af2d93-0", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": [], "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 1791, "output_tokens": 353, "total_tokens": 2144}}]
